cli_script
Based on the provided JSON data, the ARM template defines a network security group with security rules. Below is the translated bash script using Azure CLI to create the same resources defined in the ARM template.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Assign template parameters to variables\nnsgName="zytest"\nlocation="westus"\n# Since securityRules is an array, we need to handle each rule separately if they have different properties\n# Assuming the "securityRules" parameter was provided with actual rules, they would be processed here\n# For the purpose of this example, let\'s assume it\'s an empty array since it\'s not explicitly provided\nsecurityRules=()\n# Similarly, tags is an object, and we should convert it to a valid JSON string if it\'s not empty\n# For now, we\'ll assume it\'s an empty object since it\'s not explicitly provided\ntags="{}"\n\n# Create the network security group with the given name, location, and tags\naz network nsg create \\\n    --name $nsgName \\\n    --location $location \\\n    --tags $tags\n\n# If there were security rules provided, they would be added here\n# For each security rule in the array, you would run a separate `az network nsg rule create` command\n# with the appropriate properties set for each rule.\n# Since no specific rules are provided in the input, we\'re not adding any rules in this script.\n\n# Note: If actual security rules were provided, each rule would need to be processed here.\n# For example, if there were two rules, you would have something like:\n# az network nsg rule create --nsg-name $nsgName --name Rule1Name --priority Rule1Priority ...\n# az network nsg rule create --nsg-name $nsgName --name Rule2Name --priority Rule2Priority ...\n# ... and so on for each rule in the $securityRules array\n\n# End of the script\n```\n\nPlease note that the `securityRules` and `tags` parameters in the provided JSON data are set to "zytest", which is not a valid array or object, respectively. In a real-world scenario, you would replace these placeholders with actual security rules and tags. The script assumes these parameters are empty for the purpose of this example. If you have actual values for `securityRules` and `tags`, you would need to update the script accordingly.
